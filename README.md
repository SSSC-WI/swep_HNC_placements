# SWEP HNC placements

This repository contains code to summarise the placement of HNC students in social and early years workplaces.
The code reads two separate spreadsheets and generates two dashboards using the R package `flexdashboard`.

Colleges are geocoded using the postcode data from Ordnance Survey.
Maps are then generated from these locations.
