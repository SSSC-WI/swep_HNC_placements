# SWEP HNC placements

This repository contains code to summarise the placement of HNC students in social and early years workplaces.
The code reads a spreadsheet collected in MS Forms and generates a dashboard using the R package [flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/).

Colleges are geocoded using postcode data from Ordnance Survey Open Data.
Maps are then generated from these locations.
