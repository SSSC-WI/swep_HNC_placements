### About

These data have been collected by the SSSC (https://www.sssc.uk.com/) to inform placement requirements on social services programmes accepted for registration by the SSSC.

Many thanks to the staff of Scotland's colleges for submitting data and making this work possible.

### Explanation

Eg not all enrolled need a placement.

Check text with Corinne and Ann. Write for benefit of government.


Value boxes
-------------------------------------

### Colleges

```{r vb colleges}
length(unique(df$centre_name)) %>% 
  valueBox(icon = "fa-university")
```

### All Students

```{r vb students}
sum(df$enrolled) %>% 
  valueBox(icon = "fa-graduation-cap")
```

### Students on practical courses

```{r vb students on practical}
sum(df$enrolled[df$placement_req == "yes"]) %>% 
  valueBox(icon = "fa-graduation-cap")
```

### Placements required

```{r vb placements needed}
sum(df$not_placed, na.rm = T) %>% 
  valueBox(icon = "fa-question-circle")
```

### Placed

```{r vb placed gauge}
x = df %>% 
  filter(placement_req == "yes")

round(100 * (1 - (sum(x$not_placed, na.rm = T) / sum(x$enrolled))), 1) %>% 
  gauge(min = 0, max = 100, symbol = '%', gaugeSectors(
  success = c(100, 80), warning = c(25, 79), danger = c(0, 24)
))
```

### Map of students requiring placements

```{r map}

x = df %>% 
  filter(placement_req == "yes") %>% 
  group_by(centre_name, easting, northing) %>% 
  summarise(enrolled = sum(enrolled),
            not_placed = sum(not_placed),
            not_placed_log = sum(not_placed_log)) %>% 
  ungroup()

pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "YlGnBu",
  domain = x$not_placed
)

y = x %>% 
  mutate(tooltip = glue('<b>College:</b> {centre_name} <br><b>Placement students: {enrolled} <br><b>Placements needed:</b> {not_placed}'))

x %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("easting", "northing"),
           crs = 27700) %>% 
  st_transform(CRS("+init=epsg:4326")) %>% 
  leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) %>% 
  setView(lng = -3, lat = 58, zoom = 5) %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(radius = x$not_placed_log * 5,
                   fillColor = ~pal(not_placed),
                   color = "black",
                   stroke = T, fillOpacity = 0.8,
                   popup = y$tooltip) %>%
  addLegend("bottomleft", pal = pal, values = ~not_placed,
            title = "Placements needed",
            opacity = 0.8)


```

### What proportion of students have placements?

```{r proportion, eval=F}
x = df %>%
  mutate(centre_name = fct_reorder(centre_name, placements_needed),
         Placed = enrolled - placements_needed) %>% 
  select(-college, -easting, -northing, -enrolled, -placements_needed_log) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!centre_name, names_to = "type") %>% 
  mutate(type = replace(type, type == "placements_needed",
                        "Placements needed")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(centre_name, value,
             fill = type)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(type = "qual", palette = "Dark2") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "",
       x = "",
       y = "Students",
       fill = "") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 14))

ggplotly(x)
```


Data Table
=======================================================================

```{r summary table, eval=F}
df %>%
  select(-placements_needed_log) %>% 
  mutate(percent_placed = scales::percent((enrolled - placements_needed) / enrolled, 1)) %>% 
  DT::datatable(extensions = 'Buttons',
                filter = 'top',
                options = list(dom = 'Blfrtip',
                               buttons = c('copy', 'csv'),
                               lengthMenu = list(c(15, 25, 50, -1),
                                             c(15, 25, 50, "All"))))
