### About

These data have been collected by the SSSC (https://www.sssc.uk.com/) to inform placement requirements on social services programmes accepted for registration by the SSSC.

Many thanks to the staff of Scotland's colleges for submitting data and making this work possible.

### Explanation

Not all courses require student placement.
The overall number of students enrolled is shown on as "All Students", otherwise enrolled student numbers are for those courses requiring a placement.

The description of course options is:

* Option 1: the student has a placement or is employed in the sector.
* Option 2: the student requires the college to find them a placement.
* Option 3: the student is planning on attending university after their course, and so a practical placement is not required at this stage.
